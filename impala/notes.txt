Impala


it is a general purpose hql
it does not go to map reduce
Impala is optimized for fast, interactive querying, making it suitable for big data analytics.
Impala is not faullt tolerance. If node fail it cannot recover data
it design for analytical query. developed by cloudera
i have dashboard and want to show data so for analysis puuorpose instead of hive, impala is faster.because its used massive parallel processing


purpose: fast result.
not used for ingestion purpose. means to load data in datala lake . it used only for query purpose


Disadvantage
cant access acid transaction which means we can write select * from (table name), insert ,update,delete

hive: ingesting data/ creatinf data warehouse/batch processing
query/ana;utical/dashboard----Impala



----------------------------------------------------------


hue
-----------------
centralised place so execute data 
its used in ide

can write query in hue

impala store data in cas meansi within the memory

impala its own daemon server it not use yarn
impala its master master
hive master slave


--------------------


practical



go to hue--hive--
type: show create table(table name);
-copy the path /tmp----
go to cmd and connect with server by typing ssh -i "test_key.pem" ec2-user@18.134.132.202
LS
bigdata_nov_2024/ Hasnain
edit data file and add or delete colum save it
hdfs dfs -put (paste the path)

go to hive app and you see the updates but when you go to impala you can t see the updates in external file changes
so for changes 
run a command in impala
------
invalidate metadata;
------
